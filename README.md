# pc.js

pc.js  (property creator) is a JavaScript library for generating properties for a method chaining methodology similar to that on [reusable charts](http://bost.ocks.org/mike/chart).

## Development

To help develop pc.js, you need to have [Node.js](http://www.nodejs.org)
and [NPM](http://www.npmjs.org) installed. Once you have done that, run the
following from the root directory of this repository to install the development
dependencies:

    make install

## Thanks

The project structure and Makefile is based on that of D3, so a big thank you
goes to [Mike Bostock](http://bost.ocks.org/mike/) for this.
