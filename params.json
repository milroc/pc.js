It allows definitions, default values, and criteria to all be visible in one location in the file, while the actual code based off of these values is separated from this.\r\n\r\n## Development\r\n\r\nTo help develop pc.js, you need to have [Node.js](http://www.nodejs.org)\r\nand [NPM](http://www.npmjs.org) installed. Once you have done that, run the\r\nfollowing from the root directory of this repository to install the development\r\ndependencies:\r\n\r\n    make install\r\n\r\n## Thanks\r\n\r\nThe project structure and Makefile is based on that of science.js (which is based on D3), so a big thank you\r\ngoes to [Mike Bostock](http://bost.ocks.org/mike/) for this.\r\n"}
